Install 2 plugins from Visual Studio:
1. Productivity power tools

How To extract core use cases from requirment Document
---------Use cases in order---------
1. Add a gig
2. My Upcoming gigs, All Upcoming Gigs( to calendar)
3. Edit a gig, Remove a gig, add gig to a calendar, follow artist
4. View gig i am attending, Who i am following,gig feed
4.Remove a gig from calendar, unfollow artist

Define a User Experience
1. Keep it simple
2. Ignore perfection

-Code first Migration---
in Visual studio->tools->Library Package manager->package manager console->write 
"enable-migrations"
NOTE: By doing this ,this will automate the migartion and Entity framework will update the schema and we don'yt have to manually modify tables

2.  add-migration 
Note:This will create a file whose startimg with curerent timestamp which include many database operations

3. update-database
Note: this command will update the database  with inital migration

Note: To view the database ,Click on show all files icon. In AppData folder, mdf file will be there, open the file and you can see the database
in server explorer on left side TAB.

----------Creating Domain Classes-------------
1. Gig.cs
2. Genre.cs

------Once these 2 classes are created,---------------
run command in package manager console to add Gig Table
"add-migration CreateGigTable"

**How to add custom db fields in Identitymodel.cs

 public class ApplicationDbContext : IdentityDbContext<ApplicationUser>
    {
        public DbSet<Gig> Gigs { get; set; }
        public DbSet<Genre> Genre { get; set; }
        ..................
        }
        
Now run the /migration command again
"add-migration CreateGigTable -force"

Now run the update DATABASE command 
update-database

-------------31 Nov notes------------
**********HOW TO ADD DATA IN DATABASE**************
add Empty migration, using console
"add-migration PopulateGenreTable"
Note: this command will create a migration file with empty Up() and Down() method.
------------To Populate the database---------- 
In Migrations folder->PopulateGenreTable file

In UP() method we can use SQL("") method to execute any scripts
Down() method is used when we have to downgrade database i.e, it will default go to last migration OR we can spcify target migration

GOOD PRACTISE: Whenever we populate UP() method, always write the reverse query in Down() Method
For Ex: If we add INSERT Query in UP() METHOD, ADD DELETE that data query in Down() Method.

After adding Query to migration file...RUN update-database Command
***************ADDING DATA TO DATABASE CODE ENDS********************

PTR:
1. Build simple domain model
2. aim for small code-first migration
3. commit to the repository often
3. use shortcuts   (Ctrl+D=> to dublicate line few times
5. Evaluate all scenrios and list out the Pros and Cons
 *********Its your job to make design decisions**************
 
 
 ---------------ADding a basic view-------------
 1. Add a controller named as Gigs 
 Note: When we add a new control, a new folder withncontroller name is created in Views folder.
 2. Add a Create View in Gigs folder inder VIEWS Folder
 
 To Add View link, In _Layout.html page add the link appropriately
 For Ex:
  <li>@Html.ActionLink("Add a Gig", "Create", "Gigs")</li>
 
 TIP: For Designing forms, Use getbootsrap.com
